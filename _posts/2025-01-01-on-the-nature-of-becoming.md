title: "On the Nature of Becoming"
---

Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself. This is the first principle of existentialism, and perhaps the most liberating truth we can embrace. We are not born with a predetermined essence, a fixed nature that dictates our path. Instead, we are thrown into existence, and from that moment forward, we are the sum total of our choices, our actions, our commitments.

The weight of this freedom is immense. Every decision we make, every path we choose or decline, defines us. There is no script to follow, no cosmic plan that excuses our choices. We are, in the most profound sense, responsible for ourselves. This responsibility can feel crushing, but it is also what makes us authentically human.

Consider the writer who sits before a blank page. The page does not write itself. The words that appear are chosen, crafted, rejected, and refined. The writer becomes a writer not through some innate quality bestowed at birth, but through the act of writing. The same is true for all of us in every aspect of our lives. We become through doing.

Yet we often flee from this truth. We construct elaborate narratives about who we are based on our past, our upbringing, our circumstances. We say, "I am the way I am because..." and fill in the blank with endless justifications. But these are acts of bad faith, attempts to deny our freedom by pretending we are objects shaped by forces beyond our control rather than subjects who shape themselves.

The authentic life requires us to acknowledge this freedom and the anxiety that comes with it. To live authentically is to recognize that in each moment, we are choosing ourselves anew. The person I was yesterday does not determine who I am today, except insofar as I choose to carry that person forward.

This is not to say that our circumstances don't matter. Of course they do. We are situated beings, born into particular times, places, and conditions. But even within these constraints, we possess the fundamental freedom to determine what these circumstances mean for us and how we respond to them.

The question, then, is not "Who am I?" but rather "Who am I choosing to become?" And the answer to that question is written not in our thoughts or intentions, but in our actions—in the concrete choices we make each day.

We are our projects, our commitments, our engagements with the world. We are what we do. And in recognizing this, we discover both the terrible burden and the exhilarating possibility of human existence.
