title: "No Other Choice"

There is no other choice.

The sounds of the world, if you have been listening closely, have been turning fatal.
Observation is the strongest form of protest in the current times. This is the dawn of the
internet. Vitality has become an essential trade because why do you think we are the ones that
are left with no other choice? We might be the first and the only generation that would
demand an RGB keyboard to create art because who would want to use blood and sweat
anymore? The question, although at first it seems hypothetical and preposterous, the more
you think about it, the more you want to know the trajectory of this forthcoming. What is our
footing in the world, and so what other choice do we actually have?

Fear has been converted into an art form. We have inhabited it in our blood. The modern
drug, as I have understood, is not a gun but kindness. We will not be murdered using the
language of violence but through the language of empathy. If you have been closely observing
anything, you can feel the death of approach. This is not the welcoming of the new world
order but the reinvention of the older one. In a world full of fabrication, why do we seek truth
in art? One must think that the answer to that question lies in the sentence itself, and if that
thought arises in your mind, then you are probably the one whom the world needs to be safe
from.

To confront the evils of the future, it becomes necessary to absorb people in the present.
There are plentitudes of people and thus an uncanny abundance of emotions present in the
world. To only observe is enough. Sometimes art exposes this better than argument ever
could. I watched "No Other Choice" by the master, the lord almighty of present-age cinema,
Park Chan Wook. He has transcended with his craft. I had heard about the carpenter himself
becoming the tool, but this is the first time that I have seen a metaphor come to life. There are
very few occurrences where you see metaphors come to life, where sublimation is so literal
that you can see the concrete behind the idea. The composition should be limited to playing
the tune, reading that line, showing that move. Applause should be your water, not cocaine.
You must be ready to create not because you have to have that powder inside your body but
because if you do not create, if even for a moment you let go of your chance of playing the
tune, reading that line, showing that move, then you become indistinguishable from the
noise and you surrender your vitality. But who is to judge, right? Have we all not collectively
dropped the idea of sincerity? Who even cares?

Observation in times like these not only becomes style but taste. Semantic clarity is needed
when you are filled with anger. This anger is adjacent to the lack of actual taste. How
shameful it must be to become a spectator in your own life, living not on insight but on
actions guided by textbooks. People who would want to watch films only as an excuse to
knock on the doors of popular culture would not be able to actually enjoy anything. Their
lives would be incessantly defamiliarised. To read a paragraph for knowledge, to sing a song
to drown silence, to write a novel to rewrite inadequacy, to study just to avoid being nothing.
It is a shame that these people exist, but yet a greater relief, for they absorb the savagery of
society within them. They exist in a very particular vacuum and landscape so that whenever
we rest on these paths of life, we are reminded of what not to be.

We are becoming victims of inertia. Aside from what has already been bestowed upon us
involuntarily, are we becoming the byproducts of stability? Sedated by routine, are we
consenting to our own stagnation? At what point did it become cool to trade authenticity for
relevance? Had you been observing closely, you would know. The landscapes are changing
the person, not the other way around. There are choices, plenty of them. But vitality is
scarce. The living are fewer than the breathing.

It is time we stop romanticising idealism.
In this lifetime, we are not building a greater forever.
Those who miss being alive today
will always be a day behind.
And in this economy,
being a day behind
is a sin.
